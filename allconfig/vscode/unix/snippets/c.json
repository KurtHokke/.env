	// Place your snippets for c here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
    "basic include": {
        "prefix": "bincl",
        "body": [
            "#include <stdio.h>",
            "#include <stdlib.h>"
        ],
        "description": "basic include"
    },
    "ifdef": {
        "prefix": "ifdef",
        "body": [
            "#ifdef ${1:DEBUG}",
            "${TM_SELECTED_TEXT}",
            "#endif$2"
        ],
        "description": "ifdef"
    }
